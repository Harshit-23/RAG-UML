# RAG-Based UML Diagram Generator (Streamlit)

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit. It integrates OpenAI's GPT models (LLLM) and ChromaDB (Vector Database) for automated UML diagram generation using a RAG model.

The application supports two branches:
1) `main` Branch: Incorporates Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning for improved responses.
2) `non-cot` Branch: Does not use Chain of Thought, providing an alternative approach.

Additionally, we have refined the prompts using prompt engineering to enhance response accuracy.
